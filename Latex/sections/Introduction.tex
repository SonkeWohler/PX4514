  \section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Motivation}
    
      In volleyball a team's strategy is defined by the setter. This player decides by the way they set the ball which player gets to attack. When making decisions the setter must take numerous factors into account like the difficulty to perform the set, the possibility of that attack to penetrate the opposing team's defence and many more \cite{rotation,idealSetter}.

    \subsection{Aims}
  
      The aim of this paper is to present a model that accurately predicts the probability of the setter to decide to set to each player, based on their position. The model assigns scores to each position, with at least the two highest being considered extremely likely choices. 
      \\\\
      To improve viability the model is largely based on real world data taken form the 2018 FIVB World Championship and tuned to the setter of the Polish team, Fabian Drzyzga. Attempts to asses the fdifferences in decision making between different persons were not made thus far.
