  \section{Conclusion}
    
    From the model it is clear that, much of the time, the two best choices are not very significantly distinct, based on the currently used parameters. \\
    It is possible that taking into account more factors, such as the success rate of different players, will improve the accuracy further. \\
    However, considering that the setter might not want to act too predictably, there may be a limit to this optimisation  \cite[chapter 3.1]{gameTheory}.
    \\\\
    Given the clear siginificance of the model possible applications may even include training real players. However, the most obvious application lies in gaming, where there is virtually no volleyball simulation available at this time. With some randomness introduced the model could be the basis of a new simulation that would surely suffice to the impression of realism.
    \\\\
    Undoubtedly, exploring these possibilities will also provide opportunities to collect more useful data and meaningfully expand the model. Additionally, this would allow exploring the significance of the setter's personality, an aspect entirely abstracted away in so far by focusing on just one individual.
